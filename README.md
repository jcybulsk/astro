Some scripts and tools I've written to handle common tasks in astronomy research..

fitline_mcmc.pro - IDL script to analyze the CO spectra from the Redshift 
search receiver at the Large Millimeter Telescope

sfr_tot.pro - IDL script to convert Ultraviolet and Infrared luminosities into 
star-formation rates for galaxies
