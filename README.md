Some scripts and tools I've written to handle common tasks in astronomy research..

sfr_tot.pro - IDL script to convert Ultraviolet and Infrared luminosities into 
star-formation rates for galaxies

plot_rsr_spectrum.pro - IDL script to generate a nice plot of a spectrum taken 
by the Redshift Search Receiver instrument
